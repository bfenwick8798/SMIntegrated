A fork of [SeedMapper](https://github.com/xpple/SeedMapper) aiming to add integrations with other mods like Xaero's Minimap (Mostly finished) and SeedCrackerX (in progress).
## PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT XPPLE ABOUT ISSUES WITH THIS MOD! 
My code might have messed some stuff up, so make an issue here!

Thanks to rfresh for telling me how [XaeroPlus](https://github.com/rfresh2/XaeroPlus) handles adding waypoints to Xaero's Minimap (because there's no documentation anywhere that I could find)

## FAQ
* Why aren't my waypoints appearing where the structure is?

The locations of structures don't include the Y level, so the waypoint spawns at the player's Y level. This may cause waypoints for geodes or other underground structures to appear on the surface. Try digging down.

* The map is telling me there's a structure here but there's nothing here!

Make sure you have the right world seed - if you mistyped it the map will not accurately have the structures displayed. Also, check if you're on the right Y level (see above)
